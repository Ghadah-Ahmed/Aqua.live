## Faced Challenges, Self-Perspective and Ways of Improvements
It seems that I didn't succeed in achieving my goal this time. 

In this project, I faced a number of challenges. Besides the near-deadline [ I did it over the weekend ], it was my first time engaging with React library and my first step into the world of SVG with its filters, tags, and animations.

My critical points were not in coding, but rather in finding good top view fish svgs. Because I am not a graphic designer, I got frustrated with searching, and I tried to create one but I failed. Considering the time pressure, I decided to submit the closest effect I could.

This project was a long journey for me. The experience taught me a lot about web animation, SVG, and interactive artistic websites in general.
